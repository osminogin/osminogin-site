Smart tips for a traveler in Russia for optimal trip from Moscow to St. Petersburg and back, including cheap tickets, checked hostels and free bonuses (which can be useful in your future trips).

...


### Optimal route

At roughly the same prices for a train and plane tickets I'm prefer train. First, it is still cheaper, given the additional cost of the road from/to the Pulkovo airport. Secondly, it is still faster, because when you come to Moskovsky railway station, you are arrive immediately to the center of the St. Petersburg.

### Tickets

For cheapest train tickets buy them directly from Russian Railsways on official site:

[pass.rzd.ru](http://pass.rzd.ru/)

No other ticket site or reseller don't give you such prices. Also, RZD has a bonus program, which allows to pay for some tickets with miles. You can signup online (but site only in Russian):

### Hotels

My personal recommendation is [Friends on Kazanskaya](http://www.booking.com/hotel/ru/friends-on-kazanskaya.xu.html?aid=1320357&no_rooms=1&group_adults=1). 1 bed for 3 nights
