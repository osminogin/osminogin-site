[Tornote.org](https://tornote.org/) - anonymous self-destructive notes available in Internet and Tor. Use client-side encryption with SJCL (Stanford Javascript Crypto Library) and light back-end written in Golang (stdlib only). [Source code](https://github.com/osminogin/tornote)

[Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/u/osminogin/) - my containers list. Good and usable examples of separated services (such as php-fpm, prosody, tor-simple, etc). If you find something interesting star it (pleeease).
